With the gradual recovery of the aviation sector following the COVID crisis, airlines are announcing various recruitment competitions aimed at hiring flight personnel, of which there is a significant shortage. Like these, some professions require a higher than average psychomotor aptitude (e.g. surgeon), which is tested in most selection interviews. In order to maximize the chances of success, it may be useful to stimulate these abilities through tools that simulate as closely as possible what one might be subjected to.
That's what this game is aiming to do, creating also an environment that allows developers to quickly and easily make new mini-games to suit specific training purposes.
